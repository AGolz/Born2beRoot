## Harnessing the Power of Virtualization: Deploying a RockyLinux Server on VirtualBox for Ecole 42's Born2beRoot Project

### Introduction

Welcome to the world of server virtualization! As part of my educational journey at Ecole 42, I embarked on an exciting project - Born2beRoot. This educational initiative presented a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the world of operating systems, network administration, and system administration. It's designed to challenge students like me to deploy a server, enforcing stringent rules to ensure we understand and implement best practices in system and network management.

Born2beRoot is more than just a project; it's a testament to the capabilities of virtualization and its transformative impact on the world of technology. The project comes with a predefined set of rules and a well-laid-out subject matter to help guide the implementation. This, however, does not in any way limit creativity and problem-solving.

In this article, I will share my journey of deploying a server on RockyLinux in a VirtualBox environment. The experience was both challenging and enriching, providing me with invaluable hands-on experience in configuring and managing virtual servers. From the installation of the operating system, setting up network configurations, to ensuring secure user management, each step provided me with a deeper understanding of how servers function.

This article aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in undertaking a similar project. It will detail the theoretical aspects of virtual machines and VirtualBox before delving into the practical aspects of deploying a server on RockyLinux. So, whether you're a student, a budding system administrator, or a seasoned professional looking for some refreshers, this guide has something to offer. Let's dive in!
